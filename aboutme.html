                    <h2 class="firsthead-text text-center">
                        Hello Guys, 
                        My name is Yakob Kebede, 
                        I am a senior at Boston College, 
                        Majoring in computer science and minoring in management and leadership, 
    
                </div>

                <div class="newcard bor-rightwhite bg-green">
                    <h2 class="firsthead-text text-center">
                        <br>Growing up in ethiopia, I had the chance to volunteer among three non profit organizations
                        The need and importance of these organizations are great. 
                        It also showed me that as a result of issues, conflicts, lack of awareness, and many other circumstances, NGO’s or non profit organizations are more so short lived and are not lasting.
                    
                </div>

                <div class="newcard bor-rightwhite bg-green">
                    <h2 class="firsthead-text text-center">
                        <br>In addition to this, another hurdle facing NGOs or non profits deals with digital representation.
                        The lack of proper representation digitally leaves space for doubt among donors, 
                        and the lack of sustainable resources leaves the “good” NGOs from attaining necessary resources and in some cases leaves places to become dependent/worse off. 
                        
                </div>


                <div class="newcard bor-rightwhite bg-green">
                    <h2 class="firsthead-text text-center">
                        <br>                    And so, using my knowledge and experience of studying computer science and also volunteering among three non profit organizations in Ethiopia, and my background experience I present to you guys my project idea,  GREEN ROUTE in quest for betterment of sustainable lifestyle through creating an opportunity for value exchange. 

                </div>

                <div class="newcard bor-rightwhite bg-green">
                    <h2 class="firsthead-text text-center">
                    <br>Green route is a web app with focus on communication, accessibility of accurate information, and focusing on sustainable projects. It also integrates entertainment in this process, and by joining the two to be able to move away from the once sided practices of simply “giving” in terms of aid, and incorporate the two way road idea of of “working with” people in a certain area to be then able to create a platform that has a potential for value exchange beyond a completion of a project. 

                </div>

                <div class="newcard bor-rightwhite bg-green">
                    <h2 class="firsthead-text text-center">
                        <br>Our two main priorities are transparency and sustainability.  So that we can best integrate each moving part, and I hope the design and the functionality of the web App is helpful, any tip to make it better is greatly welcome.  I invite you all to join me in this process.
